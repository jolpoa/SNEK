# SNEK

This is a simple project in Unity to learn how this stuff works. So far so good.

I have chosen the Snake ripoff game to be my first project, and now I am publishing it on my Github.

##For now, implemented features are:

* Four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Imposibru)

* Timer

* Score number

* Main Menu


##There are some example screens from the game:
